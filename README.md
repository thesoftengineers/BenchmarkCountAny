# Benchmarks Count / Count() / Any()

Code example in C# using BenchmarkDotNet to perform comparative benchmarks between Collection and IEnumerable objects using methods (Count() and Any()) and property (Count)

## Overview

The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to benchmark C# methods using BenchmarkDotNet. The goal is to measure the performance and memory consumption of two different methods: `CountMethod()` and `AnyMethod()`. The first uses the `Count` method to check the number of elements in a list, while the second uses the `Any` method to check if the list has at least one element.

## Prerequisites

Before running code from this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- .NET 5 SDK or later
- BenchmarkDotNet (installed as a NuGet package)

## Running the benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Open the project in a .NET compatible IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
3. Restore project dependencies.
4. Run the project.

The benchmarks will run and the results will be displayed in the console output.

## Benchmark results

Benchmark results include metrics for runtime and memory consumption. BenchmarkDotNet will provide information about the average execution time, memory allocation and garbage collections performed during the execution of the methods.

## Customization of benchmarks

You can customize the benchmarks and add additional benchmarking methods for your specific needs. Consult the official BenchmarkDotNet documentation for more information on customizing and configuring benchmarks.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues, have any ideas for improvement, or want to add more features to the benchmarks, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
